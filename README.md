# Used Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This initiative focuses on leveraging historical transaction data to predict used car prices accurately, providing valuable insights for dealers aiming to optimize their inventory and pricing strategies.

## Data Collection
Our analysis is rooted in an expansive dataset encompassing over 367K listings, which includes detailed attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition.

## Predictive Model
The cornerstone of our analysis is a Ridge regression model, augmented with third-degree polynomial features. This model stands out for its precision, evidenced by an MSE of 0.2071 and an RÂ² of 0.7393 on the test dataset.

## Key Findings
Through rigorous analysis, we've pinpointed the primary drivers of car valuation:
- **Age**: Newer models are more valuable.
- **Mileage**: Lower mileage translates to higher value.
- **Condition**: Superior condition commands a premium.
- **Cylinders**: Vehicles with more cylinders are priced higher.
- **Fuel Type**: Diesel, along with electric and hybrid vehicles, shows a price advantage.
- **Drive Type**: Front-wheel-drive vehicles present a cost-effective option.

## Conclusion & Recommendations
Armed with the insights from our Ridge regression analysis, dealers are advised to:
- Prioritize the acquisition of recent models with lower mileage.
- Focus on vehicles in excellent condition.
- Diversify inventory to include efficient and high-performance models based on cylinder count and fuel type.
- Cater to a broad market by offering a mix of drive types.

Embracing these strategies will enable dealers to align their offerings with market demand, driving both sales volume and profitability.

## Future Directions
We advocate for ongoing model refinement and suggest incorporating emerging market trends and additional data sources to sustain competitive advantage.
