# Used Car Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This README outlines a data-driven approach to assist used car dealers in optimizing their inventory based on predictive modeling.

## Dataset Overview
The analysis is based on a dataset comprising 367K records of used car sales, focusing on various attributes of the vehicles.

## Model Selection and Performance
The Ridge regression model with an alpha value of 1.59 has been selected due to its superior performance, indicated by an MSE of 0.2071 and an RÂ² of 0.7393 on the test set.

## Key Insights
- **Year**: Newer models command higher resale values.
- **Mileage**: Vehicles with lower mileage tend to retain higher value.
- **Condition**: Cars in better condition can be priced higher.
- **Cylinders & Fuel**: Models with more cylinders and diesel engines are priced higher.
- **Drive Type**: Front-wheel drive vehicles are generally more budget-friendly.

## Deployment Strategy
The model is now ready for deployment to provide actionable insights for used car dealers.

## Conclusion
The predictive model serves as a strategic tool for enhancing the profitability and competitive edge of used car dealerships.

## Future Directions
Further model refinement and the incorporation of additional data sources are recommended for ongoing improvement.
